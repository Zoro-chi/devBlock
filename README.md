# devBlock

This is my 100hr project. But I plan to continously develop and add extra features. 
#THIS PROJECT IS NOT YET COMPLETED

devBlock is currently a social site for developers to connect with each other and share each others work, with a socket.io server for 
instant real time chat. Made with devs in mind, it is also possible to log in with your github through Passport.

Moving forward I plan to integrate a solidity back-end for web3, this enables users to make use of devBlock tokens which will have many utilities.
